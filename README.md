# PacmanFactory
This is my Pacman exercise where with a button I can push as many Pacman's as I'd like onto the screen and make them move at different speeds and in different directions.

You can fork the index.html and open it in your browser of choice. Once in the browser you will see this scree with two buttons. The first one is "Add One" and the other one is "Start Game"!

In the future I hope to possibly be able to add in obsticals and some of the ghosts from the game to be able to make a more complex pacman game.
